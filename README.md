Main goal was learn the p5js library and make something cool with it.
For now the repo don't have any songs but you can go to the [site](https://devdarkco.com/projects/musicvisualizer) and see the project by yourself. 

## Features:

* Frequency and Amplitude analyze with p5js sound library;
* 4 different animations;
* Options to see all the animations one by one or combined;
* Support to different devices (pc and smartphone);
* Html elemets with p5js dom library;
* Media controls;

**Notice:**

If you clone this repo you should add your own songs in the "*p5/assets/songs/*" folder in **.mp3** format.

**You should also add your songs in the "*songs.json*" file in order to work.**

```javascript
[
    {
        "songs" : [
            {
                "name" : "songName1",
                "url" : "fileNameSong1",
                "author": "authorOFTheSong1"
            },
            {
                "name" : "songName2",
                "url" : "fileNameSong2",
                "author": "authorOFTheSong2"
            },
            {
                "name" : "songName3",
                "url" : "fileNameSong3",
                "author": "authorOFTheSong3"
            }
        ]
    }
]
```
**For now you need to add the songs in aplhabetic order, if not the info of the song will not display correctly. You can add all the songs that you want to the json file if you have the file needed in the songs directory.**

*Until i find a solution to the sort problem, you shoulf put the songs in alphabetic order.*
